# Data-Challenge
Hello, today's writing will be about Promise Chinonso's data cleaning challenge. We only have a dirty FIFA dataset at hand. It would be better for me if there were explanations for the column names. I performed cleaning steps using Python. Let's get started.<br>


 The dataset was obtained in its raw state after web scrapping from sofifa.com. It contains the details of football players alongside their performance, updated up till 2021. It is worth noting that there are 18979 rows and 77 columns present in the FIFA 21 data..<br>
 
 
 My observation's dataset had a number of problems that were resolved after cleaning. Stay with me as I walk you through the process of cleaning up this data so that it is suitable for examination after it has been transformed from its chaotic state.
